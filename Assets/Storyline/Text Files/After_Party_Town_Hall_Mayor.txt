#001 NAME|Mayor Alexandria Shrinehill|   TEXT| First of all, let me express my condolences for the loss of your grandparents. The community loved Sven and Tilda, and they spoke often of you.|	OPTION|#002|	OPTION_TEXT|Thank you, that's so heartwarming to hear.|

Unfortunately nobody showed enough interest and we started considering taking the building down or repurposing it.|	OPTION|#004|	OPTION_TEXT|If I take care of it, could you consider to keep supporting it?  So many people really seem to need this.|	OPTION|#005|	OPTION_TEXT|You can't do that! My grandparents put their whole lives into this Center!|
